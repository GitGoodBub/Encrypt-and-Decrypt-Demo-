# Encrypt-and-Decrypt-Demo-
The AES code generates a new AES key and IV automatically, encrypts a plaintext string using CryptoStream and MemoryStream, decrypts the encrypted byte array back to plaintext, and displays the key. The RSA automatically creates a public/private key pair, Uses the public key and OAEP with SHA-256 padding, has a private key to the recover message.
